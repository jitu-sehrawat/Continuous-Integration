Continuous Integration (CI) has increasingly become a part development workflow at more and more companies. But there are still many developers, both new and experienced, who have never used it even if they have heard of it.

My goal with this series is to take the practical parts of CI processes I use in JavaScript projects and show how useful they are, and how easy they can be to set up with modern tooling.

CI/CD (CD stands for Continuous Deployment) has become such a common part of my development life that I even set it up on many of my own personal projects.

Throughout this series we'll cover:
- Setting up GitHub actions for CI automation
- Linting CI with ESLint
- Testing CI with Jest
- Continuous Deployment with Netlify
